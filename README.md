Hi! I'm Abigail, a fullstack, frontend leaning developer living and working in New York.

I've always loved digging in to new topics and finding clear solutions to difficult problems. I've funneled these interests into neuroscience research focusing on the mechanisms underlying stress / anxiety and medical case management for New Yorkers affected by HIV/AIDS and other chronic conditions. More recently, I worked as a teaching fellow at Grace Hopper Academy after going through the program myself. Currently, I'm a software engineer at Etsy, where you can find me working on the design systems team,  learning the ins and outs of a large codebase, how to set meaningful standards for a wide variety of use cases, and most of all having a big old brain blast every single day!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
